# Apollo Core Integration - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

The Apollo Core integration for WP Event Manager has been **successfully completed**. This implementation addresses the missing DJ and Local/Venue display functionality on single event pages and provides complete portal/dashboard management capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Single Event Page - DJ Display
**Problem:** Events couldn't display associated DJ information on their single pages.

**Solution:** Created a comprehensive DJ display template that shows:
- DJ thumbnail/profile picture
- DJ name with link to profile
- DJ bio/description
- Social media links (Website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube)
- Support for multiple DJs per event

**Location:** `/templates/dj/content-single-event_listing-dj.php`

### ✅ Single Event Page - Local Display
**Problem:** Events couldn't display associated Local/Venue information on their single pages.

**Solution:** Created a comprehensive Local display template that shows:
- Local thumbnail/logo
- Local name with link to profile
- Local description
- Contact information (Address, Phone, Email)
- Social media links (Website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)

**Location:** `/templates/local/content-single-event_listing-local.php`

### ✅ Portal - DJ Dashboard
**Problem:** No dashboard existed for users to manage their DJs.

**Solution:** Created a full-featured DJ management dashboard with:
- List of all user's DJs
- View, Edit, Duplicate, Delete actions
- Event count per DJ
- Status indicators
- Pagination
- Add DJ button

**Location:** `/templates/dj/dj-dashboard.php`
**Access:** Via shortcode `[dj_dashboard]`

### ✅ Portal - Local Dashboard
**Problem:** No dashboard existed for users to manage their Locals/Venues.

**Solution:** Created a full-featured Local management dashboard with:
- List of all user's Locals
- View, Edit, Duplicate, Delete actions
- Event count per Local
- Address display
- Status indicators
- Pagination
- Add Local button

**Location:** `/templates/local/local-dashboard.php`
**Access:** Via shortcode `[local_dashboard]`
